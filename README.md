These are my solutions for the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

They are written for Python 3.7 and, since they use features introduced in that version, no lower. Some solutions depend on NumPy for performance and occasionally convenience.

In my code, I try to strike a balance between clarity, brevity, and efficiency. It might be worth mentioning that these are *not* the same solutions I use when submitting my answers; those are a lot messier, but the general approach usually remains the same. Notes can be found [here](extra/README.md).
